-- I have uploaded the power BI file final project--


**Project Overview: **
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Power BI report and dashboard for Adventure Works, a company looking to leverage their sales and customer data for strategic decision-making. The project demonstrates proficiency in data visualization, analysis, and the application of Power BI functionalities such as table visualizations, column charts, line charts, KPIs, forecasting, and Q&A features.

**Project Details:**
Objective: 
To create an interactive Power BI report that provides key insights into sales performance, customer trends, and product categories, empowering executives at Adventure Works to make data-driven business decisions.


**Steps Taken:**
Core Visualizations:
Created a Table Visualization to display sales data including Product ID, Product Name, Order ID, Order Status, and Order Total, serving as a quick reference for the executive team.
Developed a Clustered Column Chart to show the relationship between product categories and order totals, highlighting key revenue-generating products and underperforming categories.
Designed a Line Chart to visualize sales trends over time, offering insights into peak and drop points to help identify seasonal sales patterns.



Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Integrated KPIs for Order Total, Customer Count, and City Count, allowing executives to monitor sales progress, customer reach, and market expansion efforts.


Forecasting:
Implemented a forecasting feature on the line chart to predict future sales trends, ensuring executives can plan for future demand based on historical data. Configured the forecast with a seasonality of 12 and a confidence interval of 99%.


Q&A Visual:

"Which customer city has the lowest average order total?"

"Which product subcategory has the highest product weight?"
